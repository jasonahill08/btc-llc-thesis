# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm Jason A. Hill â€” a writer, researcher, and Bitcoin builder.

I started my Bitcoin journey in 2017 with a small purchase and no real understanding. By 2020, I had gone full orange-pill. After exploring the altcoin space in 2021, I committed fully to Bitcoin â€” and never looked back.

Since then, Iâ€™ve moved from private mining to running a private company that stacks Bitcoin as its core treasury strategy. I structure the company to protect privacy, maximize long-term accumulation, and enable access to capital without giving up control.

But doing this alone has its limits. Iâ€™m looking to join a serious Bitcoin-native team where I can contribute meaningfully through research, writing, and operations. I bring over 8 years of experience in documentation, team systems, and cross-cultural leadership â€” and Iâ€™ve spent the last few years applying that mindset to Bitcoin infrastructure and education.

This site is part of that mission: to demonstrate what I know, what I can build, and who Iâ€™m looking to work with.

**Letâ€™s build something sovereign â€” together.**
